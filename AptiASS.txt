1) What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that
the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the
mixture is 40 litres?

Initial ratio
milk-water ratio = 2:3
Let's assume the initial quantity of water = 3a 
quantity of milk = 2a 
Quantity of Milk:
Given that the quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 liters.
So, 2x (initial quantity of milk) = 40 liters
Solve for a:
2a = 40 ,a = 40 / 2 ,a = 20
Initial Quantity of Water:
Since we know the initial quantity of milk and the initial milk-water ratio:
Initial quantity of water = 3a = 3 * 20 = 60 liters

Final ratio
We want to change the milk-water ratio to 4:11.
So, final quantity of milk = (4 / (4+11)) * Total mixture
Final quantity of water = (11 / (4+11)) * Total mixture
Given that the final quantity of milk is 40 liters,
(4 / (4+11)) * Total mixture = 40 ,  (4/15)* total mixture = 40
solve for the total mixture:
(4 / (4+11)) * Total mixture = 40
Multiply both sides by (4+11):
4 * Total mixture = 40 * 15
Total mixture = 40 * 15 / 4
Total mixture = 150 liters

Quantity of Water to be Added:
We have found the total quantity of the mixture needed to achieve the final ratio.
We know the initial quantity of water is 60 liters.
So, the quantity of water to be added = Total mixture - Initial quantity of water
Quantity of water to be added = 150 liters - 60 liters = 90 liters
so you need to add 90 liters of water to the milk-water mixture to change the milk-water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11


2) Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?

to find where the  equation 2x+3y=0 meets we can substitute 0 with either x or y so that we can get the point of intersection
let us find the point of intersection with x axis and put the value of y = 0 solve for x
2x + 3(0) = 0
2x = 0
x = 0
the equation 2x+3y=0 meets x axis at (0,0)
let us find the point of intersection with y axis and put the value of x = 0 solve for y
2(0) + 3y = 0
3y = 0
y = 0
the equation 2x+3y=0 meets y axis at (0,0)
the equation 2x + 3y = 0 intersects both the x-axis and y-axis at (0,0) which is known as origin. 

3) a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?

it is given that a^2 - b^2 = 19 which is the difference between the squares of two numbers
we know the formula a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)*(a+b)
now (a-b) * (a+b) = 19 we can also write 19 as 1*19
so now  it's (a-b) * (a+b) = 1*19
by equating these two equation we get two equation
a-b = 1  ----->i
a+b = 19 ----->ii
by adding equation i and ii we get ,
2a = 20
a = 10  ,by putting the a value in equation ii we got the b value as 9 (b=9)
therefore, the two positive integers a and b are 10 and 9 respectively

4) Find a^+b^3+c^3+3abc , where a+b+c=5 & , a^2+b^2+c^2=10?

Given that,
a+b+c=5 ------>i
a^2+b^2+c^2=10 ----->ii

a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2−ab−ac−bc) ---->iii
put the equation (i) and (ii) in (iii) 
a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (5)(10−ab−ac−bc)
a+b+c=5 squaring on both sides
(a+b+c)^2 = 25
a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca = 25
10+2ab+2bc+2ca = 25
2ab+2bc+2ca = 25-10 , 2ab+2bc+2ca = 15 , 2(ab+bc+ca) = 15
ab+bc+ca = 15/2, -(ab+bc+ca) = -15/2
a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (5)(10−ab−ac−bc) put the value 
a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (5)(10-15/2)
a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (5)(20-15/2) , a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = (5)(5/2)
a^3+b^3+c^3−3abc = 25/2

5) Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first
two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits
of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these
numbers & the square root of their sum.

Let the two-digit numbers be xy and yx, where x and y are digits.
the digits of the first two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers. 
this means x and y differ by 1. So, we have two cases:
x is the smaller digit and y is the larger digit.
y is the smaller digit, and x is the larger digit.
we have 2 cases
Case 1: x is the smaller digit
x can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 
y is then x + 1
create the numbers xy and yx based on this:
xy = 10x + y
yx = 10y + x
we know that the sum of these two numbers is a perfect square:
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 11x + 11y = 11(x + y)
To get a perfect square, x + y must be a multiple of 11,
as 11 times a perfect square will give you a perfect square.
x + y = 11 (because 11 times 1 is 11)
x = 5, y = 6
So in this case, the two-digit numbers are 56 and 65.
Case 2: y is the smaller digit.
y can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 
x is then y + 1
create the numbers AB and BA based on this:
xy = 10x + y
yx = 10y + x
we know that the sum of these two numbers is a perfect square:
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 11x + 11y = 11(y + 1) + y = 11y + 11 + y = 12y + 11
To get a perfect square, 12y + 11 must be a multiple of 11,
as 11 times a perfect square will give you a perfect square.
12y + 11 = 11K (where K is a positive integer)
we can see that 12B is one less than a multiple of 11. The only value of B that works in this case is B = 10 - 1 = 9.
in this case, the two-digit numbers are 98 and 89.
let's find the square root of the sum for each case:
in case 1: Sum of 56 and 65 is 121, which is a perfect square. The square root of 121 is 11.
in case 2: Sum of 98 and 89 is 187, which is not a perfect square.
the two-digit numbers that meet the conditions are 56 and 65, and the square root of their sum is 11.
